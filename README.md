# Scripts for Adobe After Effects

To install a script, put it into `Support Files\Scripts\` directory inside AE installation directory.

To run a script, select it in the `File` > `Scripts` menu in After Effects. You need to restart AE for newly installed scripts to appear.

You can also run scripts without installation by selecting `File` > `Scripts` > `Run Script File...` option.
